Food Waste Management System


----- FOOD FOR GOOD -----


INTRODUCTION AND WHAT MADE US CHOOSE THE TOPIC:-

According to this 2021 guide, around 80 billion pounds of food is thrown away every year along the entire supply chain of a food product â€“ i.e. from agriculture to retail, to hospitality, to private households. And 40 % of the waste comes from restaurants, grocery stores and food service companies.

Restaurants have formed an integral part of urban living today. From the employees following hectic schedules to hostelites for education purposes or for mothers to have a day off work, take-outs and eat-outs have become a common occurrence.

The main issue that lies in the domain of food production through restaurant chains is the amount of food that is wasted at the end of the day.
Thus we decided to find the measures of curbing the problem and provide a sustainable solution.

Our solution will not only reduce everyday's waste generation but also will help to dispose it off.



MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:-

Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent (day) and one or more independent (ingredients) variables. It helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It predicts continuous/real values.

Multiple Linear regression has been implicated by predicting the amount of quantity of every ingredient on a particular day of the week.
It is to be noted that the ingredients are widely used items in all the restaurants on a daily basis.


HOW DOES THE MODEL WORK?

User will have 3 options:
1. To know todays prediction of what quantity of ingredients will be required today
2. Book a slot for pick-up service at the end of the day
3. To add today's used quantity of ingredients

The dataset will be customised for indivisual restaurants and will be updated every day.

Prediction is done via a Machine learning model.

At the end of every day you can book your preferable time slot. Pick-up services will be provided. Wet waste will be put in compost pits where biogas, fertilizers and other bi-products will be made. The leftover food will be donated to the NGO's.  

This is a model which can help you predict the amount of ingredients required on a particular day. The user enters the day for which he/she wants to know the ingredient consumption. The predicted data will appear on the interface.



HOW HAVE WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTAGE?

Inadequate estimation of food needs is another major contributor to restaurant waste (this includes prepping food just as much as portioning it).
Thus if we know beforehand how much ingredients will be needed today, food wastage can be reduced.

Along with predicting the food on a daily basis, we have also provided a solution in the scenario of food going to waste. The remaining food can be donated to the nearest NGO which have registered for the food donation. Slot bookings have also been provided for increasing the efficiency and saving time so that the food reaches to the needy before it reaches the dustbin.
In the case if wet waste generation, it will be sent for creating compost and bio has to the registered compostings sites.



FUTURE SCOPE:- 

1)THE UI INTERFACE CAN BE CONCERTED INTO A APP.
2)LARGE DATA SET FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR CAN BE TAKEN ALSO TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION HOLIDAYS AND FESTIVALS AS PER. WE HAVE CONSIDERED A FEW DAYS' DATA AS OF NOW.
3)AS EVERY RESTAURANT HAS ITS OWN TERMS AND TYPE OF FOOD AND CUISINE IT PROVIDES THE GIVEN MODEL CAN BE CUSTOMIZED. INGREDIENTS CAN BE MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY



TECHNOLOGY USED:- 

Google Colab Notebook - for basic coding
Streamlit, open source app framework in Python language was used for the creation of the web app. The main reason for choosing this was due to the compatibility of the framework with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn,NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
